# hello-world

This is my first repository on GitHub! Not much to see here right now as I am new to this world. So far, I have been studying the following: SQL, Python, Java, JSON, XML, Xpath, XQuery, XSLT, MySQL, SQLite, Relational Algebra, and Relational Design. I have experience with Windows and Linus/OSX.
